this project follow the pattern of Ether Bank project, but use EOS instead of Ether as collateral.

I think stablecoins can be one of the most important killer applications of the blockchain, and EOS Bank can have a significant impact on the expansion of the EOS ecosystem.

EOS Bank is an altruistic project and can only be completed by EOS community contributions.
